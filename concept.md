Computer networks involve connecting individual computers to create the internet.

The origin of computer networks can be traced back to the Cold War era, when the United States and the Soviet Union competed to launch the first satellite into space. In 1957, the Soviet Union achieved this milestone with the launch of Sputnik. In response, the U.S. government established the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA).

ARPA recognized the need for effective communication among its various locations and, as a result, developed ARPAnet to facilitate seamless communication. Initially, ARPAnet was only accessible from four locations in the United States: MIT, Stanford, VC Launch, and Utah.

During this period, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) was utilized for data transmission, and the World Wide Web (WWW), created by Tim Berners-Lee, was introduced. The WWW served as a platform for storing research papers from ARPAnet's team, allowing other members to access and read these documents.

The rules and regulations governing computer networks are determined by the Internet Society, which accepts idea submissions through Requests for Comments (RFC).

Protocols play a crucial role in computer networks as they define the rules established by the Internet Society:

- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) ensures secure data transmission.
- UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is used when full data details are not critical. It establishes low-latency, loss-tolerant connections for internet applications.
- HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) defines data transmission formats.

Other essential components and concepts in computer networks include NAT, DHCP, ISP, LAN (Local Area Network), SONET, FRAME RELAY, MODEMs for digital-to-analog signal conversion, and routers for data packet routing based on IP addresses.

Various topologies dictate how computers are interconnected:

1. Bus Topology
2. Ring Topology
3. Star Topology
4. Tree Topology
5. Mesh Topology

The structure of computer networks is often represented using the OSI Model (Open System Interconnection Model), which consists of seven layers:

1. Application Layer
2. Presentation Layer
3. Session Layer
4. Transport Layer
5. Network Layer
6. Data Link Layer
7. Physical Layer

Each layer has specific functions:

- The Application Layer is implemented in software and includes applications like ordering apps and messaging apps.
- The Presentation Layer converts data from the Application Layer into machine-readable binary format.
- The Session Layer manages connections, data transfer, and session termination.

The TCP/IP Model, a simplified alternative, includes:

1. Application Layer
2. Transport Layer
3. Network Layer
4. Data Link Layer
5. Physical Layer

Data centers consist of collections of servers, and you can send requests to services like Google using commands like "ping google.com."

Applications can be connected to data centers using two main models: Client-Server and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) connections.

DNS (Domain Name System) is crucial for translating domain names into IP addresses. DNS classes include subdomains, main domains, and top-level domains. The top DNS servers are known as root servers, and ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) manages their databases.

The Transport Layer is responsible for transporting messages between the Network and Application Layers. UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol often used for speed-sensitive applications like video conferencing and gaming.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is used in HTTP and ensures data reliability through congestion control, error control, and reordering of data.
